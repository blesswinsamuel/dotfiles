  # beet move [-d <destination dir>] query -> move items matching a query to anywhere in filesystem
  # beet move [-t] - timid mode which will ask again before really moving or copying the files.

  # beet update [-p] -> update library (and optionally move files) to reflect metadata changes in individual files and file deletions
  # Update metadata from FILES/ONLINE -> LIBRARY

  # beet write [-p] -> actually write library info to individual files
